# Infinet
This game is all about evolution. You start by creating your own universe with the Big Bang, which gives you a couple of elements to work with. Then, by combining different elements, you advance through time until you reach 21st century with medicine and other technologies. Then, you continue the game in a theoretical future until humans become a type 3 (galactic) civilization. You can lose if you destroy the universe or humanity (e.g. by creating a disease, which wipes out all humans)
Please note that the game is still under development and is not enitrely finished yet.
